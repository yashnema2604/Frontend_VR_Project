# Frontend_VR_Project

We have created this project for a state level hackathon

VR-EXPLORER aims to use VR technology to protect and promote cultural
heritage in an interesting and accessible way. By developing a digital archive of
cultural sites and objects, we seek to stimulate interest, foster cultural
appreciation, and ensure that no barrier can stop someone to explore and learn
about new cultures.
